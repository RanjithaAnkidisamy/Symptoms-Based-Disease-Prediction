- This is my Final year project to detect disease from the given symptoms and summarise the medical report based on EHR. 

### Prerequisites
- You must have Scikit Learn, Pandas (for Machine Leraning Model) ,nltk library , pickle and Flask (for API) installed.

### Project Structure
This project has two major parts :
